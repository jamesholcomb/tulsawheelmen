In case of emergency (ICE) the PIN can be text messaged to a number and will reply back with who you are and who to call. It has the ability to offer as little or as much information you want communicated in an emergency. The ICEdot PIN is displayed on any of our products, including:</p>

    Our latest innovation is revolutionizing the athletic safety industry: The <a title="ICE Dot Crash Sensor" href="https://icedot.org/products/41-Crash-Sensor" target="_blank">ICEdot Crash Sensor</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Crash Sensor is a small device that adheres to a helmet and uses low energy bluetooth technology to pair with a smartphone app. The sensor is filled with accelerometers that gauge changes of force, speed and impact. When the sensor detects an impact it will set off an emergency countdown clock on your phone. If the countdown is not manually turned off it will alert your emergency contacts of an incident and send them a GPS location of where your impact occurred.

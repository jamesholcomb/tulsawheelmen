    Since 1979&#8230; Our non-profit organization has promoted responsible bicycling in all its forms for men, women, and juniors. We make every effort to be an inclusive organization with as much diversity as possible including advocacy, fundraisers for charitable organizations, racing, clinics, community involvement, safety, and fitness just to name a few. We are committed to promoting road racing and cycling in Tulsa and the surrounding region by promoting quality races, supporting local cyclists, and advocating safe riding in the city. In 1999, 2000 and 2015, the Tulsa Wheelmen were recognized as <a href="https://www.usacycling.org/club-of-the-year.htm" target="_blank">USA CYCLING’s “Club of the Year.” </a>This success can be attributed to our ability to focus on the needs and desires of our members and to be able to adapt and change with the times. We are committed to continuing that tradition of success today and in the future.

#### Racing

The Tulsa Wheelmen is a USCF recognized race team. Our club&#8217;s goal is to provide an environment where new racers can learn from more experienced members and see how far their training and their bikes will take them. In conjunction with that, the Tulsa Wheelmen promote several USCF sanctioned races each year that attracts racers from all over the region.

#### Advocacy

The Tulsa Wheelmen actively promote responsible bicycling and the protection of bicyclists&#8217; rights with an emphasis on educating the public and government officials as well as cooperative efforts with law enforcement and other local, state and national cycling organizations.

#### Training Rides

Many of our members participate in our training rides to better their cycling or overall fitness. We provide rides for learning about road racing and cycling as well as rides that will push your physical limits. Designated training rides vary throughout the year, with regular rides on Saturday morning, from 41st and Riverside, usually 8:00 a.m. during the colder months, 7:00 a.m. during the warmer months.  These rides vary in length between 60-80 miles, sometimes more.   Monday and Wednesday have group rides from 96th and Riverside, about 30 miles each, beginning at 3:30 p.m. during standard time, 5:30 during daylight savings time.  There is also a Wednesday Night Ride north from 18th and Jackson usually departing at 5:30 p.m.

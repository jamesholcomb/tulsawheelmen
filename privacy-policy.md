#### Use of Cookies by our Site

Our Site uses a technology called “cookies”. A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. Cookies also allow us to store Users’ preferences and to record session information, for purposes including ensuring that Users are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements and to customize newsletter, mailing list, advertising, and Web page content based on browser type and user profile information. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our site. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set—each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences—however, you must enable cookies from our Site in order to use most functions on our Site. Our Site may also use a technology called “tracer tags”. These may also be referred to as “Clear GIFs” or “Web Beacons”. This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our Site. These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our Site for you and other future website visitors.

#### Links

Our Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources. These links are for your convenience only and are not under our control. You acknowledge and agree that Tulsa Wheelmen and our Site are not responsible for the availability of external Web sites or resources, and Tulsa Wheelmen and our Site do not endorse such Web sites, their contents, advertising, products, or other materials. You further agree that Tulsa Wheelmen and our Site shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage, viruses or loss caused or alleged in connection with your use of content, goods or services available on an external Web site or resources.

#### Marketing & Contact Preferences/Opt-out /Updating or Removing Information

At various points during the registration process on our Site, when signing up for a Tulsa Wheelmen Activity, or when subscribing to a newsletter or mailing list, you may be asked to indicate your willingness to allow us to communicate with you on an on-going basis, or receive updates or notifications regarding the Service. We will honor your preferences. At any time, however, you may (a) stop the receipt of a particular promotional or notification email by clicking on an “unsubscribe” hyperlink contained in any promotional or notification emails we send you, or (b) opt out of further disclosures of your personal information to third parties or by contacting us at: [mailing address] or by e-mailing us at [email address]. It may take up to six (6) weeks to modify your preferences.

#### Security

All information, including order information such as credit card number and delivery address, provided to the Site is transmitted through the Internet using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL, an industry standard, is a coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. Since any order information you provide to us on the Site will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order other items through our Site. The most recent versions of Netscape Navigator™ and Microsoft Internet Explorer® can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Netscape and Microsoft Web site respectively. We protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Site. We do not store credit card information permanently so you must supply the information each time you order.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Tulsa Wheelmen and the Site will take reasonable measures which it believes are appropriate to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, however, Tulsa Wheelmen cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information.

#### Privacy Statement Modifications

From time to time we may modify or amend this Privacy Statement in order to comply with new laws or regulations or to reflect future changes in our business practices. Any changes in our policies will be communicated in this page so please check back on occasion. We also may post a notice on our Site or send an email describing the changes.

This Privacy Policy was last modified on November 1, 2013 and is effective immediately.
